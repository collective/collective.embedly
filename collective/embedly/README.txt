Introduction
============

This package provides TinyMCE visual editor support for embed.ly service:
videos, images and other rich media can be inserted to Plone from different
services through one API.

The approach here is to use the Transform machinery to replace the URL with
embed code by calling the embed.ly API.

There are more than 200 services that support embed.ly service. These are such
video sharing sites as Youtube, Blip.tv, Vimeo; such audio streaming services
as Grooveshark, SoundCloud, last.fm; such image/photo stocks as Flickr, and
many other: GoogleMaps, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

This product was developed by http://quintagroup.com for Plone collective,
sponsored by Headnet ApS http://headnet.dk.

Usage
-----

To embed media from the embedly-supported external resource to Plone:

* Go to the object's edit form, select some text and click
  'Insert/Edit Embedly link' button.

* In the panel add link and configure extra parameters in 'Advanced' tab.
  Check http://embed.ly/docs/arguments for params description.

* The text should now look like linked. TinyMCE makes the whole passage linked,
  so keep in mind that the whole passage will later be substituted with
  embedded media.

* Save this page. Now when rendered, there will be "preview" from embed.ly
  service inserted instead of the linked text.

Note
----

* collective.embedly does not fix errors in provided URLs

* you can check if your URL will be transformed calling embed.ly manualy, for example:

   o video URL http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1NPLlhFTVk
   o you should call http://api.embed.ly/1/oembed setting 'url' parameter with your value
   o http://api.embed.ly/1/oembed?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1NPLlhFTVk
   o http://api.embed.ly/1/oembed?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1NPLlhFTVk&fromat=xml format result as xml

* You can set parameters by going to the Plone control panel / Embedly settings:

   o cache usage and timeout
   o service URL verification
   o API key

* You can update the regular expression for supported services by calling
  http://yourhost/plonesite/@@update_embedly_services

* The default is to not pass along an API key, your requests to embedly will be
  anonymous and based solely on IP address.
